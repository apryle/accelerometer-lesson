- "this is my addition"
- "How do I read data into R?"
- "How do I assign variables?"
- "What is a data frame?"
- "How do I access subsets of a data frame?"
- "How do I calculate simple statistics like mean and median?"
- "Where can I get help?"
- "How can I plot my data?"
objectives:
- "Read tabular data from a file into a program."
- "Assign values to variables."
- "Select individual values and subsections from data."
- "Perform operations on a data frame of data."
- "Display simple graphs."
keypoints:
- "Use `variable <- value` to assign a value to a variable in order to record it in memory."
- "Objects are created on demand whenever a value is assigned to them."
- "The function `dim` gives the dimensions of a data frame."
- "Use `object[x, y]` to select a single element from a data frame."
- "Use `from:to` to specify a sequence that includes the indices from `from` to `to`."
- "All the indexing and subsetting that works on data frames also works on vectors."
- "Use `#` to add comments to programs."
- "Use `mean`, `max`, `min` and `sd` to calculate simple statistics."
- "Use `apply` to calculate statistics across the rows or columns of a data frame."
- "Use `plot` to create simple visualizations."

We are studying inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis,
and need to analyze the first dozen data sets.
The data sets are stored in [comma-separated values]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#comma-separated-values-csv) (CSV) format. Each row holds the observations for just one patient. Each column holds the inflammation measured in a day, so we have a set of values in successive days.
The first few rows of our first file look like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
tmp <- read.csv("data/test-data.csv", header = FALSE, nrows = 5)
write.table(tmp, quote = FALSE, sep = ",", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
rm(tmp)
```

We want to:

* Load data into memory,
* Calculate the average value of inflammation per day across all patients, and
* Plot the results.

To do all that, we'll have to learn a little bit about programming.
